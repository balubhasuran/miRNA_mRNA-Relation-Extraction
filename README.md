# miRNA_mRNA-Relation-Extraction
miRNA_mRNA Relation Extraction from PubMed articles

In the current study, we use four LLMs namely GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLaMA-2, and Claude-2 to extract the miRNA-gene interactions from PubMed abstracts. We apply genomics approaches to summarize the role of miRNA in regulating gene expression. The major contributions include:

The release of annotated corpus on miRNA-gene interaction. 
The use of LLM for extracting the interactions between miRNAs and genes and to summarize the role of miRNA in regulating gene expression. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use LLM for miRNA-gene interaction.
Applying genomics for predicting novel associations between miRNAs and genes and identifying the associated pathways. Our approach uncovered many previously undiscovered regulatory mechanisms.
